// Ondine, Cantor of the Drowned Choir: the boss.
//
// This file is her mind and her body's rules: a duellist's footwork between blows, the choice of the next move, the
// playing of a move part by part (boss_moves.js is the table), poise and the stagger, the change of phase, dying.
// What she fights with that is not a body (rings, blades of light, the wave) is boss_fx.js.
//
// The surface the others use (docs/engine.md, "Fighters"): char, kit, pos, yaw, hp, hpMax, alive, state, radius,
// invulnerable, takeHit(hit), reset(spawn), applyMotion(m), puppet, phase, enterPhase(n), poise, staggered, name, ai.
// Beyond it (docs/modules/boss.md): forceMove(name), moveName, stage, fx (what is loose in the hall), lightLevel.
//
// She is 3.67 times a man and her clips are a man's: a level cut at her waist passes metres over the pilgrim's head.
// So the moves are built from the strokes that do come down to him, and each has an `aim`: where in her own frame
// the clip's own stroke lands. She turns her WHOLE BODY to put him there. The blade is never aimed by her wrist: it
// lies in both fists by the measured hold (docs/grips.md) and goes where Mixamo's great-sword clips carry it. After
// the pose (applyPosture) only this is added: a lean of the whole body and the sword arm lowered from the shoulder
// where a move asks for it (the lunge, the Tide), and the floor: a blade is a solid thing, so where a stroke would
// carry its point under the floor the point rides ON it (the wrist gives 15 degrees, both arms the rest).
//
// Solid bodies (docs/impact.md): `solid` is her body as capsules in the world, for the pilgrim's push-out; she moves
// in sub-steps, held off walls by a radius that grows with her open wings, and never comes to stand on him.
//
// Nothing here uses Math.random(): one generator, rng(game.seed + 17), reseeded in reset(), decides everything.
