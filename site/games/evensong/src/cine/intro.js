// The opening. Cut to the score's cues (assets/audio/music/music.json → intro.cues; docs/modules/score.md):
//
//    0.0  candle   1  'candle'  black; one candle on black water comes into focus, a great pale shape far behind it
//    6.0  nave     2  'nave'    the nave from high in the west: one crane down to the water, the moon in the rose window
//   15.0  doors    3a 'doors'   the great doors: his lantern and his shape coming in out of the dark, at a man's own walk
//   18.0           3b 'boots'   his boots at water level, a ring from each step
//   21.0  sight    4  'sight'   over his shoulder, far off: the Cantor standing before her standing sword, tall and still
//   24.0  mask     5a 'mask'    her mask in profile, the moon behind it; the candles round her gutter; her head turns; her line (25.5)
//   27.5           5b 'listen'  his helm, close: the light of his lantern shrinks under her words
//   30.0  rise     6a 'rise'    from the nave, low and wide: she turns to face him, a quarter turn on two heavy steps
//   33.0  chord       ...       and her pipes open like wings on the great chord, the moon behind them
//   36.0           6b 'gaze'    closer and from below: the mask against the open fan looks down the nave at him
//   39.0  draw     7a 'hilt'    the wind of it reaches his cloak; his flame gutters; his hand starts across his body
//   40.0           7b 'grip'    close on his left hip: the fist closes on the hilt (40.4) and the steel leaves the scabbard (40.5 to 40.9)
//   40.9           7c 'draw'    the point swings free and up and he is in his guard; the lantern flares
//   42.0           7d 'regard'  her face: she looks from him to her sword
//   45.0  sweep    8a 'hand'    her hand closes on the grip of the standing sword
//   46.4           8b 'windup'  both fists on the grip, the great blade drawn back
//   48.0  fall     8c 'ring'    from above: one sweep; a ring runs out over the water and a circle of candles dies
//   51.0  name     9  'name'    both in one frame across the water; her name; she comes on two steps; the camera settles
//   57.0  end                   behind the pilgrim exactly where the play camera is, and play begins
//
// She is the Cantor: she stands and sings, without a sound. She stands facing south across the choir (as the cantoris
// side does), so from the nave she is in profile with the moon behind her, her sword standing in the floor before her,
// her pipes folded: still and tall, her hands open at her sides, a statue that breathes. Nobody kneels and nobody
// prays, here or anywhere in the game (Kevin, 8 Nov). She turns to the pilgrim on the bar before the great chord.
// From 33.0 on everything is as it was when she rose from her knees there: the same stance in the same place.
