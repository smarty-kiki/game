// The standing sky (realm 7 of 8, and the ending): a lake a hand deep that holds the whole night sky and every star
// that has fallen out of it; star-birds standing round the horizon; then first light, the wind, and the far jetty.

// The path's centre line is the page's composed line (a boat left alone is carried along it). The edges are soft:
// colliders stop the boat at everything solid, and beyond the channel the water leans the boat back. The ride ends
// here: the path has an end stop and no veil out. Light and water change along the way with the boat's distance
// (set.js: the dawn clock `e`, the sunline, the wind front); this file gives the state the area is entered in.
//
// Switches for looking (besides the engine's): &play=lettinggo&t=33 is the showstopper 33 s in; &play=falsedawn&t=6 the
// aurora half unrolled; &labels=1 names every stand-in; &only=set,kit / &skip=cast build some modules;
// &blur=0 draws the stars as sharp as the view allows (what the matching with the mirror does: light.js);
// &tune=w.reflectFloor:0.7,l.exposure:1.3,dn.fog.density:0.003,p.sky.milkyway.gain:1.4 tries other numbers without
// editing the plan (w. = the water at night, wd. = at dawn, l. = the starlight look, a. = the aurora's, dn. = the dawn's,
// p. = the whole plan; colours as %23rrggbb).
