// The orchard in flood (area 2): docs/art/orchard.md is what is built here, docs/building-an-area.md is how.
// In the last light after sunset a flooded apple orchard stands in full blossom over still water skinned with fallen
// petals; a colonnade of white trunks leads to one tree as tall as a cathedral.
//
// This file is the realm: its waterway, its light at the start, its water, its sound, and the list of modules that
// build it (src/realms/orchard/). Every number comes from src/realms/orchard/plan.js: read its header first, because
// the page's (s, d) and the engine's path (s, d) are two different things from the pond onward.
//
//   set     the place and its light: sky, backdrops, bed, mist, the light states, the water and its petal skin
//   heroes  the oldest tree and the hero pieces (the loft's door, the wall's gap, the cart, the hives), the kept lamp
//   kit     the avenue trees and every repeated thing; the loft we are entered through
//   cast    everything alive (stage 3)
//   stage   the route of moments and the two set pieces (stage 4)
//
// Developer switches (besides the engine's): &labels=1 names every stand-in; &only=set,kit / &skip=cast;
//   &dusk=0..1          holds the light at one point of the dusk wherever the boat is (0 afterglow, 1 blue hour)
//   &w=key:value,...    overrides keys of the water's look in every light state (&w=mirrorDarken:0.15,clarity:4)
//   &petals=0           the water without the petals lying on it;  &cover=<x> multiplies how much of it they cover
//   &lastlight=0        without the last light on what stands above the avenue;  &sky=plain  the sky without its painting
//   &bank=0             without the afterglow's bank (the band of lit mist in the west);  &limit=0  without the hold under the bloom
//   &keep=0             the mirror without the white trunks given back (set.js, "THE WATER KEEPS THE WHITE TRUNKS")
//   &gapmist=<x>        how far the water beyond the wall goes into the mist of the way out (0: not at all);  &bandmirror=0  the band in the mirror as the grade leaves it
//   &rings=<seconds>    something touches the water 9 m ahead of the boat every so many seconds (to watch a ring travel)
//   &crowd=1            adds the cast's multitudes as still stand-ins at the planned counts (for measuring cost)
//   &lamp=hero          hangs the remodelled kept lamp (src/engine/lamp-hero.js) on its smith's hook and chain, in place
//                       of the ride's present one; the area takes it by itself the day lamp.js becomes that file
//   &counts=1           writes what the modules grew to .shots/orchard_counts.json
