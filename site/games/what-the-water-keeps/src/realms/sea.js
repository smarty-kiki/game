// Art direction: docs/art/sea.md. How it is built, stage by stage: docs/build/sea/. Its numbers: src/realms/sea/plan.js.
//
// The path's centre line is the page's composed line (a boat left alone is carried along it). The edges are soft:
// colliders stop the boat at everything solid, and beyond the channel the water leans the boat back (set.js).
// Light and water change along the way by the number L (the sea's light), which set.js drives from the showstopper's
// clock and the boat's distance along: this file gives only the state the area is entered in.
//
// Switches for looking (besides the engine's): &play=answering&t=26 is the showstopper 26 s in (postcard 7);
// &play=firstlight skips the first dark; &play=whale starts the whale beneath; &rest=1 shows the sea as it is before the
// rain wherever the boat is put; &labels=1 names every stand-in; &counts=1 writes what the kit grew to
// .shots/sea_counts.json; &only=set,kit / &skip=cast build some modules.
// &tune=w.touch.amount:1.2,l.bloom.strength:0.5,lit.exposure:0.8 tries other numbers without editing the plan
// (w. = the water, l. = the look at rest, lit. / air. / dark. = the other light states; colours as %23rrggbb).

// (No trial copy of the kit is left: the reefs' second pass, terraces of columns, was finished and went into kit.js on 9 November with its switch
// &kitnext (docs/build/sea/6-reefs.md); cast_deep.next.js, the jellies drawn as light, went into cast_deep.js the same night. The other five trial
// copies, of set, light, air, heroes and heroes_b, were the live files line for line and went at stage 5 with their switches.)
