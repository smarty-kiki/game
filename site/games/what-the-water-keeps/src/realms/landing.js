// The landing (the prologue, 81 m): the last gold of a May evening in a great reed bed. A tea-brown backwater, a long
// crooked footbridge wading across it, the sun burning behind the reeds, and the boat let go. Gilded, level, teeming.
// The only daylight of the ride; the title is shown over its first view.
//
// What is built here: docs/art/landing.md. How, stage by stage: docs/build/landing/. Every number: src/realms/landing/plan.js.
//
// The path's centre line is the page's composed line. The boat waits moored at the staithe (titleView, departure);
// on 'Push off' the flame crosses from the kept lamp, the boat is let go and the water eases it out to the line
// (stage.js). Light and water turn from `look` / `water` into `lookEnd` / `waterEnd` by distance (the engine's blend);
// set.js drives what the engine does not: the current, the sinking sun, the sun's path on the last 26 m.
//
//   light    the area's own light and paints, shared by every module (shared.landing): the shade, the rim, plants,
//            and since stage 2 the three tiles (timber, reed, wicker) laid along the grain of every member, with the
//            wet band and dry line where timber meets the water (docs/build/landing/2-light.md says how to wear them)
//   set      the place and its light: sky, sun (in the sky, in the reeds, through the door's cloth), far planes, the
//            ground and bed and what is laid on them, the grass on the turf, mist; the current
//   heroes   the monument: the long bridge
//   heroes_b the other hero pieces: staithe, rick, gangway, jetty, sunk punt, gate masts
//   kit      the reeds, the far reed mass, stubble, the cloths of the door (and what of the layout's kit still stands in)
//   kit_plants   reedmace, iris, sedge, lily pads, hornwort (stage 2, Plants)
//   kit_pilings  pilings and revetment, traps, bundles, low ricks, withies (stage 2, Pilings)
//   cast     everything alive (stage 3); the heron's stand-in
//   stage    the route of moments (stage 4); the passages in (the crossing and the release) and out (the door)
//
// Developer switches (besides the engine's): &labels=1 names the stand-ins; &only=set,kit / &skip=cast;
//   &play=crossing sends the flame across (with &t=3.5 it is half-way: postcard 2);
//   &at_s=70 holds the light, air and water of that place wherever the boat is;
//   &counts=1 writes what was grown to .shots/landing_counts.json; &crowd=1 adds the cast's multitudes as still
//   stand-ins at the planned counts (for measuring cost); &stems=painted puts the far reed stems back under the
//   painter's filter (to compare);
//   &tune=l.exposure:1.1,e.fog.density:0.006,w.mirror:0.2,we.sparkle:0.4 tries other numbers without editing the plan
//   (l. the look, e. lookEnd, w. the water, we. waterEnd, s. the sky, sun. the sun, p. the plan; colours as %23rrggbb;
//   an entry of a list by its number: p.lamp.daylight.halo.1:0.9, p.sunGlow.reeds:2, p.gate.backlight:0.4,
//   p.gate.shade.to:60, p.plantLight.glow.1:0.3).
