// The orchard in snow (area 6): docs/art/snow.md is what is built here, docs/building-an-area.md is how.
// A frozen flood before dawn, drawn in ink on white paper: a bare orchard stands in falling snow, and the one black
// thing in the picture, the water, still shows the same trees in blossom with the lamp alight.
//
// This file is the realm: its waterway, its look, its water, its sound, and the list of modules that build it
// (src/realms/snow/). Every number comes from src/realms/snow/plan.js: read its header first, because the page's (s, d)
// and the engine's path (s, d) are two different things from s 58 on (the path is the composed line: a metre right of the
// orchard's centre line, then left of the lamp and round the islet).
//
//   set       the place and its light: the two skies, the land, the cave, far things, fog, the light states, the water
//             and its black road, the snowfall (light.js: the area's light, its materials, the mirror's own evening)
//   heroes    the monument: the oldest tree bare and under snow, the same tree in blossom in the water, the two lamps
//   heroes_b  the other hero pieces: the cliff, the bridge, the outlier, the stumps, what was left for the night
//   kit       the orchard's trees (wood, snow, and blossom in the water), birches, pollards, fence, shelf, pans, small things
//   cast      everything alive (stage 3)
//   stage     the route of moments and the showstopper (stage 4)
//
// THREE WORDS, used strictly (page): WINTER = drawn only in the direct view (ctx.only(obj, 'direct')); MEMORY = drawn
// only in the water's reflection (ctx.only(obj, 'mirror')); SHARED = drawn in both. One object on the wrong layer
// spoils the area.
//
// Developer switches (besides the engine's): &labels=1 names every stand-in; &only=set,kit / &skip=cast;
//   &layer=winter | memory | shared   shows one layer alone (the page's debug key): winter = what only the direct view
//                       has, memory = what only the water has (shown above the water too, so that it can be looked at),
//                       shared = what both have
//   &state=cave | birch | plain | thaw   holds one light state wherever the boat is
//   &snow=0             no snowfall (to look at the geometry)
//   &proof=1            adds the proof of the lying mirror: one bare tree at (124, +5), in blossom in the water
//   &lamp=hero          hangs the remodelled kept lamp (src/engine/lamp-hero.js); the area takes it by itself the day
//                       lamp.js becomes that file
//   &mirror=1.25        another resolution for the water's mirror (look.mirrorScale; the area runs at 1)
//   &stroke=0           the lit lamp without the area's own stroke of light (as the water alone gives it back)
//   &counts=1           writes what every object of the area weighs (triangles, instances, layer) to .shots/snow_counts.json
//   &w=key:value,...    overrides the water's look for one picture (numbers and #colours; a dot reaches into skin):
//                       &w=mirror:0.75,streak:2,skin.width:1,deep:%23101020
//   &navlog=<name>.json writes where the boat went during &t seconds (with &drift=1) to .shots/
