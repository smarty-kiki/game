//                        beneath by the whole town (its colour; how much of it): the far hills are dark against it and
//                        the middle water mirrors it. footMist: [how much, over how many metres of height] of mist on
//                        the feet of things further than 40 m (the air itself is thinner than the page's: far things are

//   waterLit             the water where the town burns in it: an ember glow, low in the lit streets (at the height of

// The water's character, as made in stage 2d (docs/build/town/2-light.md says what moved from stage 1 and from the
// page, and why). In short:
//   the mirror   no clear window: the mirror grows with the glancing angle alone. fresnel 3 (fourth holder; it was 9,
//                then 6.5): from an eye 1.1 m up, whatever stands taller than two metres is mirrored within a few metres
//                of the hull, 15 to 35 degrees under the horizon, and at 6.5 the water was a window there (the tower's dial
//                came back at a tenth): nothing lay on the lake but its last two degrees. Now the mirror is a tenth looking
//                down at 35 degrees, a third at 18 (the dial's reflection), a half at 12, three quarters at 4: the tower
//                and the dark of the sky lie on the middle water over the town beneath, as in the key painting, and
//                what it mirrors is a little richer than the world (mirrorSaturate). A ring or a wake shows in it as
//                leaning water does.
//   the glass breathes   mirror 0, long low swells (waveScale 4, waveHeight 0.2) that sway the reflections and, through
//                a stronger refraction (1.8 over 12 m), everything under the surface: the tremor. The wake is gentler
//                (0.13) so that it still moves an eave by less than half a metre.
//   the body     green-teal looking down, a dark blue-teal away (the key painting's water against the plum air); the
//                tint by depth is nearly neutral and clarity is 110 (third holder: it was 60, and the square 22 m down
//                lay under four tenths of the body's colour), because the area's own material swallows the town
//                with the distance sight travels through water (light.js) and twice would be too much.
//   crests       a faint line of sky-light along the crests of rings and the wake (rippleGlow); the body of that light
//                is surface.js's sheet over the living water.
// (fifth and sixth holders of stage 2d, 7 to 8 November, night. What changed, and why, is in docs/build/town/2-light.md:
//   the mirror   fresnel 4.5 (it was 3): half a mirror ten metres out, two thirds at fifteen, a twentieth looking down over
//                the side: "from about 15 m outward the sky and the tower lie on the water over the town beneath", and near
//                the boat the water is a window and the town its own teal (at 3 the sky's plum lay over every picture
//                that looks down). THINGS keep the gentler curve: light.js strengthens what stands above the water in the
//                mirror's own picture (uTownMirror2), so the tower is still doubled to the hull.
//   the tremor   tremor 2.8 over a reach of 5 m: what lies beneath wavers with the standing water, eaves and window rows
//                lean and sway (0.5 bent a sight nine metres long by two centimetres: there was none). The bending
//                grows with the length of water the sight passes through up to refractReach, and that was 12 m: seen
//                at a glance a row of windows fifteen metres off melted into flames while a roof under the keel hardly
//                stirred. At 5 m with a stronger tremor the near roofs waver more and the far windows keep their
//                shape. The wavelets themselves are finer and a little higher (waveScale 1.6, waveHeight 0.24). The
//                wake bends by `refraction` over the same reach. Reduced motion: half.
//   on the water sheen: sky-light on leaning water, drawn by the water itself (rings and wake as fine arcs; on water at
//                rest a few pale strokes, each hiding a little of what lies under it; a breath at a glance; the lamps'
//                share), and rest: the fine ring a boat lying still sheds. Both were this area's own, by hand.
//   the line     waterline: the water's own line of light where it meets a wall, a stack, a roof awash, the rider's hull:
//                continuous and as thin on a slope as at a wall. The area's material keeps only a breath of warm light
//                at the line where the town burns under it (light.js uTownSurf.w 0.25; it was the whole line, at 0.7).)

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ the deep cast (stage 3, group "Deep": docs/build/town/3-cast-deep.md)
// The old carp's ways, for cast_deep.js and for whoever stages them. Places are [s, d, y] (the page's: metres along
// the route, to the right of it, above the water); y is the height of the carp's SPINE as it truly is. The swimmers
// family draws a deep fish higher than it is (0.45 m seen from straight above, 1.0 m from 4 m off, 1.5 m from 10 m,
// 1.7 m from 25 m and more), so every line here lies that much LOWER than the fish is seen; near other things it lies
// where the fish, raised by 1.7 m, still clears them. A fourth entry { speed } is metres a second from that point on
// (0.6 where none is given). Every line was checked against the layout (houses, church, tower, hour ring, hall,
// terrace, skiffs and painters, lamps, washing, poplars, lime, the fountain's plume): the log says how.
//   patrol   closed, about 235 m, clockwise seen from above. Down-route along the port side of the composed line,
//            6.5 m off it (points 0 to 2); round the end of the square, short of the poplars (2 to 6); back up-route
//            behind the tower, in front of the terrace's drowned windows (6 to 9); up the lane between the skiffs and
//            the right bank's houses (10 to 12); one turn in the water at the street's end, before the church's west
//            front: across it from right to left 9 m down (15 to 19: the page's moment at s 96), then down-route
//            along the church's flank, 6 m to starboard of the composed line (19 to 21); back down the lane, deeper
//            (25 to 27); and across the composed line, away from a boat that comes down it (28 to 31)
//   under    the page's moment at s 146 ("straight under the keel at y -2.5"). Straight under the keel no fish can be
//            seen, so the line runs ALONGSIDE the composed one, 4.2 to 4.6 m to port and 3 m down: and (second look) the
//            OTHER way. The first line ran the boat's own way: the water carries a boat left alone at 0.9 to 1.2 m/s
//            here and the carp does 0.6, so the fish swam ahead of the bow for a minute and its line ended before the
//            boat was level with it: a pilot fish. Now it comes UP the square: it shows out of the water's veil some
//            20 m ahead on the port bow, passes beside the keel 4.3 m off, its line drawing away from the boat's all
//            the while (it never points at the hull), and is astern; then it turns away to port before the church's
//            apse (a turn 14 m across), goes back down the square before the hall, 5 to 6 m down, and into its
//            patrol. A boat left to the current meets it at s 168, twenty seconds after the cue; one that is paddled,
//            sooner and further down; a rider who has stopped at the cue sees it come to within 14 m and turn away
//   shallow  the showstopper's last part: the shallow leg, drawing away from the composed line to 8.5 m to port of it
//            (the rise is taken here), then down into the mouth of the avenue between the poplars, round, and back
//            up-route to the patrol behind the tower
//   turn     the showstopper's first part, for a carp that is deep and far: up from behind the tower in one rising
//            turn round its shaft (9.5 m from its axis, from 15 m down), across the composed line 4 to 5 m down, ahead
