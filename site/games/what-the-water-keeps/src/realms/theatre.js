// A drowned opera house keeps its hour without us: a copper beech in a column of moonlit rain where the dome fell in,
// five tiers that kindle as the boat goes down the aisle, a curtain that rises on old machines, and then the fall.
//
// The area's numbers are in theatre/plan.js; what its modules share (the house's light, stand-ins) is in theatre/lib.js.
//   theatre/set.js      the place and its light: the plain building, sky, the far lake, the shaft, the three light states,
//                       the show clock, the water's rain, the kept lamp
//   theatre/cove.js     the cove between the top tier and the dome: the painted sky, the ribs, the round windows
//   theatre/air.js      the glow in the air round every bracket (and what the flames count for in the water)
//   theatre/heroes.js   the monument and the hero pieces
//   theatre/kit.js      kit pieces, multitudes, the close band
//   theatre/cast.js     everything alive and moving
//   theatre/stage.js    the route of moments, the showstopper, sound
// Developer switches (see theatre/lib.js): &c=27 holds the show clock; &ballast=0; &raw=1; &labels=1; &only= / &skip= modules.
