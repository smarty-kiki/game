// The interface shell: the title card, the few things on screen during the ride (the name of each realm on
// arrival, first-minute hints, a pause button and a music toggle), the panel (pause, options, controls) and the
// ending. How it looks, and why its lettering can always be read: src/style.css.
//
//   initUI(engine, { dev })    called once by main.js when the first realm is ready. With dev = true (the URL
//                              names a realm) the title card is skipped and the ride starts at once.
//
// What it touches in the engine: start(), paused, frozen (the boat is held still while the title card is up, and
// let go by the interface itself only if the first area has not done so 45 seconds after 'Push off'),
// input.enabled, input.sensitivity, boat.motion and reducedMotion, and, for the title card only, the boat's place
// on the waterway (see TITLE_OVER_SCENE) and one extra render() to look at the picture behind the card (the card
// is lettered in ink over a bright picture and in pale paper over a dark one: readTitleTone). During the ride the
// picture is looked at once as each name or hint appears, straight after the engine has drawn it (chooseInk). It talks to
// engine.audio only through unlock / setMusicOn / setMusicVolume / setSfxVolume / setPaused, each call guarded
// and none of them made before the rider begins. It also gives the canvas role="application" and a description,
// and keeps it out of reach while the title card is up. And it stands between the keyboard and the engine in one
// case: a letter key of the ride pressed while a button has focus goes no further (LETTER_KEYS).
// The controls are shown without being asked for (LEGEND): one line under 'Push off', and the same line across the foot
// of the picture for the first quarter minute of each ride. On a touch screen the thumb's stick rests in sight at the
// lower left (updateStick), and a mark at the picture's edge points the way on for a rider turned from it (updateWay).
// Buttons for steering and looking (an option, off unless asked for: WCAG 2.5.7, nothing in the ride may need a
// drag): nine small buttons at the foot of the picture during the ride, which reach the boat through
// input.hold({ throttle, steer }) and input.lookStep(yaw, pitch) and nothing else. How a press is read: "the pad",
// below. Their log, with the runs and the measurements: docs/build/interface-dragging.md.
// The accessibility audit (WCAG 2.2 A and AA, 8 November 2026), state by state, with how to repeat every
// measurement: docs/build/interface-audit.md.
// One thing it puts in the page outside #ui: a layer between the picture and the interface (.grounds), which holds
// what the lettering over the picture stands on (syncGrounds; src/style.css, "the grounds").
//
// A realm may choose the view behind the title card:   titleView: { s, d, heading, yaw, pitch }   (metres, degrees)
// Saved options live in localStorage under 'quiet-current:options:v1' (music, volumes, motion, sensitivity,
// realm names, the buttons for steering and looking, picture quality, and which hints the rider no longer needs).
//
// Test switches (a development host only). tools/pageshot.py photographs the page as soon as this file says that
// everything in the picture has arrived (index.html holds the headless browser's clock until then), so every state
// that needs a click or some time is reached at once from the URL:
//   &uitest=a,b,c  any of:
//       still      no fades: every state is simply there. A headless browser gets this by itself; fades puts them back
//                  (and then pageshot's --wait is the time the page runs, at one frame a frame)
//       title      show the title card even when the URL names a realm        begin   press 'Push off'
//       options    open the options (from the title card if it is up, else in the pause panel)
//       controls   open the controls (likewise)                               pause   open the pause panel      resume  then resume again
//       name       show the realm name and keep it       hints   show one hint and keep it (&hint=steer|paddle|look|drift)
//       hold       show the dots that mean "loading the next waters"            stick   show the touch stick
//       awake      keep the corner buttons awake         idle    show them as they are at rest
//       quality    choose another picture quality (shows the Apply and reload button)
//       ending     the end of the ride: the pale veil and its two choices      moored   'Push off' again, as after 'Ride again'
//       ghost      every letter and mark invisible, every ground left: what the lettering really stands on
//       spacing    a reader's own text spacing (WCAG 1.4.12: line height 1.5, letters .12em, words .16em, paragraphs 2em)
//       buttons    show the buttons for steering and looking, whatever is saved      pressed   two of them held on
//       debug      a line of state in the corner         fresh   ignore saved options
//   &as=keys|touch|gamepad  as if the rider held that: the wording of the hints, and where the words go (on a touch screen
//                           the name stands top left and the hint clear of the thumbs: src/style.css, data-hands)
//   &tone=day|night         letter the title card in ink, or in pale paper, whatever the picture
//   &ink=day|night          the same for the words during the ride (the name of a place, a hint, the waiting dots)
//   &flat=white|black|8a7   put one flat colour in place of the picture (the worst pictures there are, for measuring contrast)
//   &boxes=x.json           post where every piece of lettering and every control is, and its colours, to the dev server
//                           (.shots/x.json): with the photograph, that is all a contrast measurement needs. The same file
//                           lists every control Tab can reach, in order, with its role, name, description, state and size
//                           (`reach`), and what a screen reader is given of the picture, the panel and the headings (`heard`)
